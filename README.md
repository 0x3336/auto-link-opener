# auto-link-opener

Welcome to the auto link opener! This tool allows you to automatically open multiple website URLs from a text file, with the option to add a delay between each URL.

## Features

- Automatically open multiple website URLs from a text file
- Prompts user to select from three delay options:
  1. No delay
  2. Fixed delay (user specifies a single number for the delay in seconds)
  3. Dynamic delay (user specifies a range for the delay in seconds, and the delay will be randomly generated within that range for each URL)

## Notes

- The text file should contain one URL per line.
- The tool uses the default web browser on your machine to open the URLs.
- The fixed delay and dynamic delay options require the user to enter a valid number for the delay in seconds.

I hope you find this tool useful! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
